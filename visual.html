            <p>The Café Wall illusion is a visual phenomenon where parallel lines appear to be sloped 
            or curved due to the placement and pattern of adjacent colors or shapes. </p>
            <p>If you click on the image, the colors will be changed to colors with less contrast, 
            revealing that the lines are actually straight.</p>

            The Penrose Stairs, also known as the "Impossible Staircase," is an optical illusion
             depicting a staircase that appears to ascend or descend endlessly in a loop. The steps are
              arranged in such a way that the viewer's brain interprets them as a logical structure,
               even though it is geometrically inconsistent.</p>

    <h1>Checker Shadow</h1>
    <img id="checkers" src="images/checkershadow_double_med.png">

    <div class="desc">
        <p>This is an illusion that highlights the brain's interpretation of light and shadow. 
            The illusion consists of a checkerboard pattern with alternating light and dark 
            squares placed under a shadow cast by a cylinder, with 2 squares marked with A and B. 
            The shadow covers part of the checkerboard as well as Square B. Despite the reality that Square A and Square 
            B are the same color, we assume one is darker because it is under a shadow.</p>

    <img id="checkers2" src="images/Grey_square_optical_illusion_proof2.svg.png">
    <p class="desc">In the second iamge, the gray rectangle that connects between the 2 squares, A and B shows that 
        both are clearly the same. This shows how we also use our enviroment, like lighting to determine
         the color of many things.
